## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Pink (#F44E77), based on the accent color visible in the reference image, will provide vibrancy and serves well for interactive elements.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), a desaturated tint of the primary pink, creates a clean and unobtrusive backdrop for content.
- Accent color: Teal (#4ECDC4), analogous to pink but with a different hue, draws attention to key actions and elements.
- Body font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font that provides a modern, machined, objective, and neutral aesthetic, suitable for body text.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif font with a precise, contemporary, fashionable, avant-garde look that matches the prompt and creates clear hierarchy.
- Animated format chips with slide-in effects to visually represent different data formats.
- Subtle elevation (shadow-md) to visually separate panels and content sections.
